      <p>
       Project management and automation involve using metrics to track progress and ensure adherence to delivery timelines. It also requires organizational and technological structure, as well as adequate headcount, to become more strategic in focus. Better monitoring of projects, a central location for tracking assigned projects, and ensuring that supporting project roles are performing all contribute to successful project management. Employing an iterative design/build process, reviewing release notes, reducing labor involved in maintaining document library, and adding program management function can further streamline project management and automation.

         Trust and accountability are crucial for the success of any team. It's important to prioritize security and ensure everyone is on the same page, even if there are knowledge gaps and restrictions. Effective communication, collaboration, and regular progress reports help keep everyone accountable and on track towards achieving clear objectives. Breaking down larger goals into smaller tasks with specific deadlines and assigning them to team members is key. Trust is also important for breaking down barriers and improving team dynamics.

         Project management and automation involve using metrics to track progress and ensure adherence to delivery timelines. It also requires organizational and technological structure, as well as adequate headcount, to become more strategic in focus. Better monitoring of projects, a central location for tracking assigned projects, and ensuring that supporting project roles are performing all contribute to successful project management. Employing an iterative design/build process, reviewing release notes, reducing labor involved in maintaining document library, and adding program management function can further streamline project management and automation.
