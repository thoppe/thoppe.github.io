         Project management and automation involve using metrics to track progress and ensure adherence to delivery timelines. It also requires organizational and technological structure, as well as adequate headcount, to become more strategic in focus. Better monitoring of projects, a central location for tracking assigned projects, and ensuring that supporting project roles are performing all contribute to successful project management. Employing an iterative design/build process, reviewing release notes, reducing labor involved in maintaining document library, and adding program management function can further streamline project management and automation.
