         Improving teacher knowledge and skills involves incorporating various strategies such as using technology and games in the classroom, identifying students' difficulties and learning process, motivating and encouraging students, and being open and understanding. Teachers should also focus on developing their own skills through continuous professional development and learning from colleagues and conferences. Effective classroom management, textbook development, and various assessment techniques are also crucial components of improving teacher knowledge and skills. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance the teaching and learning process and create a positive environment for students to succeed.

         Motivating students involves building relationships and encouraging one another through positive reinforcement, praise, and student-to-student talk. Using technology and games in the classroom can also be effective, but it requires careful implementation. Teachers should strive to be open and approachable, and focus on student-centered learning to improve skills and engagement. Additionally, understanding the benefits of metacognition and different types of assessment can help overcome speaking difficulties and improve overall learning outcomes.

         Language learning and assessments are crucial for students to acquire useful knowledge, improve their listening, speaking, and writing skills, and to be motivated to learn English. Teachers' perceptions and the use of technology and games can also help with motivation and class participation. Assessments can be formative or summative, and it is important to use them at the appropriate time to evaluate students' skills accurately. The conference provided teachers with solutions to challenges faced in the classroom, such as how to overcome speaking difficulties and how to organize a conference.

         Teaching productive skills, such as speaking and writing, can be challenging for teachers. Strategies for motivating students, such as using games and formative assessments, can help overcome these difficulties. It is important to focus on speaking skills and to avoid talking too much as a teacher. Understanding metacognition and utilizing various resources can also benefit the teaching process.
