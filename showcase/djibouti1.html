         Motivating students involves building relationships and encouraging one another through positive reinforcement, praise, and student-to-student talk. Using technology and games in the classroom can also be effective, but it requires careful implementation. Teachers should strive to be open and approachable, and focus on student-centered learning to improve skills and engagement. Additionally, understanding the benefits of metacognition and different types of assessment can help overcome speaking difficulties and improve overall learning outcomes.

         Language learning and assessments are crucial for students to acquire useful knowledge, improve their listening, speaking, and writing skills, and to be motivated to learn English.

           I have learned today how to manage my classroom effectively and how to motivate students to participate in speaking and writing activities. The training program at CFEEF could benefit from more emphasis on these strategies.

           One suggestion I have for the training program at CFEEF is to incorporate more resources and strategies for teaching productive skills. I appreciated learning about the challenges and benefits of metacognition and how to use games in the classroom to motivate students.

           I found the discussion on the difficulties of teaching speaking and writing skills to be particularly helpful. As a teacher, I often struggle with finding effective strategies for these areas. Learning about formative and summative assessments was also valuable. What other suggestions can we make to the training program at CFEEF to address these challenges?

           The conference provided great insights into teaching productive skills and overcoming the challenges that come with it. I appreciated learning about the stages of listening and how to use the spinner game for speaking practice. The development of English textbooks and the importance of including productive skill activities was also informative. I am excited to implement these strategies in my classroom.
